  <summary>Notes</summary>
  
### Notes
- Slayer tracker for token drops and 20% chance drops uses a 12x12x12 bounding box centered on the player to detect the drops. If you are out of the range of the item drop, it will not count on the tracker.
- API commands may take a while depending on your internet connection. The API may also go down.
- If you use too many API commands too fast, you can and will get rate-limited.
- Importing fishing uses your sea creature kills, which may not always be exactly correct (e.x. someone else kills your sea creature).
